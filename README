This repository contains all code used to build, train, and test NLP classifiers in predicting star ratings for
a given Yelp review.

The full project report can be found in 'doc/report.pdf'

The 'source/models' directory is meant to contain all of the models used in our ensemble, but some models
are too big to be easily shared on GitHub. All of the used models can be accessed in this google drive
link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19nPa7JNrcmwgRc-IbpxSotIavP2GF3n7?usp=sharing 

To test the final model on a given dataset (in the form of a .jsonl file), first ensure that all necessary models
are downloaded from the above Google Drive link and placed in the 'source/models' directory. The models that
need to be downloaded are in the 'source/models/.gitignore' file. After that, enter into the 'source'
directory, and run the following to install all necessary dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, still in 'source/', run the following to test the model:

    python test_submission.py <JSONL TEST FILE>

The output from the model will be placed into a file called 'output.jsonl' within the source directory.

To see the accuracy and MAE of the model, pass in a test file where each json object has the correct stars 
for a given review under the "stars" key (see the 'challenge' test sets in 'test-sets/'). Then, run the same
test script with the following option:

    python test_submission.py --show-accuracy <JSONL TEST FILE>

Additionally, you can use a '--keep-texts' option to keep the text from the reviews in the output file.
